Hands on Large Language Models

1. In this Chapter, we will do the following 3 things: 

(a) Download the open source Microsoft Phi-3 LLM from HuggingFace
(b) Query the LLM 
(c) Generate a response from the LLM

2. In this Chapter, we will do the following things: 
(a) We use a Large Language Representation Model for Movie Reviews Sentiment classification. 
(b) We use a pre-trained and fine-tuned RoBERTa based NLP model.

3, In this Chapter, we will do the following things:  
(a) We use a Flan-T5-small Generative model for movie review classification. 
    Create pipeline,
    prepare data in prompt format,
    feed the data to LLM model,
    generate movie review classification,
    evaluate performance

4. In this Chapter, we implement language models to perform text clustering on ArXiV research paper abstracts. 

We use a combination of:

(1) Sentence Transformer for embedding documents
(2) Using UMAP for dimensionality reduction
(3) Clustering the reducing embeddings using HDBScan
(4) Inspecting the clusters.

5. In this lecture, we use ChatGPT API to perform the task of movie review classification.

We use a ChatGPT(GPT 3.5-turbo-0125 paid model
